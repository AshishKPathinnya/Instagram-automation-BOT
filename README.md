# Instagram-automation-BOT
The python code stimulates a BOT which helps in automatically logging in to Instagram as well as scrap images from the hashtags of your preference.
The main.py file is used for logging into your instagram account (make sure you have enetered the correct username and password in both the files).
Once logged in it will automatically scroll the home feed and then go to the explore section of instagram page.
The post.py file will execute our desired hashtag which we want to search for in the explore section (make sure you write the hashtag of choice in both the files).
When the hashtag section opens it will automatically download all the metadata (for this project we used downloading only images) in the file path that you will have to again mention in both the files.
Also the likes button in all the posts will be automatically clicked.
To make the reader understand better I have made two separate files, you can also combine both of them and execute in a single file (make sure errors are resolved if any arises).
Also ensure you have selenium installed (write pip install selenium at cmd).
For this project we used chrome, you can also use firefox or any other browser but their is a small catch you must have the compatible version of web driver and the browser installed in your system.
Example: Check the version of chrome you are using in your system and then install the webdriver for it from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
